Overview:

The app that I am proposing for my android application project is a type of management app for a business, in this case it is a ‘Snooker Academy’. The app will service two types of users, the customers that play in the academy and the owners of the academy. 
The customers will log-in or create a new account to use the app`s features such as: 
1.	Ability to buy virtual credits which can be used to play instead of using actual cash or credit. 
2.	To reward the customer upon buying the credits, an equivalent number of reward points would be given to the user which they can redeem for more virtual credits or snooker related physical rewards. 
3.	The customer would also be able to see any vacant tables and book them using the credits. 
4.	The history for all the category transactions would be shown.
5.	Update username, email and password.
6.	Contact the business by:
a.	Calling the business by clicking a button on the app.
b.	Finding the business on google maps.
c.	Sending a query email to the business.
